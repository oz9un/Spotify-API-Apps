Well... I got some reasons:
1. Spotify has a great API documentation, but sometimes it can be very confusing.
2. I got some free time and wanted to monkey about it.
3. Most importantly, I love GitHub Actions. This repository will be used in one of my GitHub Actions project (will share).

### What does that code do?

- Firstly, it creates a freshie **OAuth** token *(using parameters: refresh token, client id, client secret...).*
- Then finds your favorite song's track id *(using parameters: song, artist).*
- Lastly, adds that songs to your playlist! *(using parameters: playlist).*
