## To-do:
- requestUserAuth.py don't follow the redirections yet, will be fixed.
- Search Song creates token with 'modify-playlist-private' scope. It's just overkill for now. Will fix.

## searchSong:
- Search Song uses 'refreshOauthToken' for new token generation.
- It requires two inputs from user:
    - Artist's name
    - Song's name

- It returns most searched one about that keywords.
- It also can sort songs by their popularities.
